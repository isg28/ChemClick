<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 10 44 34â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49fce4f3-5f4c-4dd9-af21-3673bd1b6cf9)


Code Blue has been tasked with creating a web application designed to facilitate learning of core high school chemistry concepts by serving as an interactive, dynamic, and autonomous learning tool.  The focus is to encourage high school students to learn by creating knowledge rather than just recollecting it. This website will house the curriculum of our client and will be designed with our client's students in mind.

This project is being undertaken by the development team Code Blue, composed of undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento. Its members consist of Jessica Villanueva, Danica Galang, Isabel Santoyo-Garcia, Anthony Dominguez, Maria Valencia, Marilyn Sarabia, Zhenkang Zhao, and Oliver Jezildzic.

<!-- TIME LINE -->
## Project Timeline
At this moment, we've completed the first part of senior project (Fall semester 2024). We will continue this project in the Spring semester during the second part of senior project. Here is our projected timeline and what we expect to get done during that phase of the development process.

</div>

### Explanation
This is a very high-level overview of what we plan to develop in the Spring. Thus, these are the major milestones that we hope to accomplish to be on track to present our final product for senior showcase. Within these major milestones will be multiple sub-tasks that we will individually assign to each developer with story points to indicate difficulty and time spent on the task. There will also be acceptance criteria that each developer must complete for their task in order for it to be considered finished and marked "done". 

Additionally, as part of our project management, here is an example of the tasks that we have in the backlog that we will assign to sprints according to their priority.

</div>

Finally, here is an example of a story that we've created sub-tasks for in Jira and assigned to developers whose responsibility it was to finish coding before the sprint ended.

### Current Status
Out of eight total sprints, we have finished four during the Fall semester and are looking forward to continue development in the next four sprints during the Spring semester of 2025.

<!-- ERD -->
## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Below is the current Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for our project. This diagram represents the relationships between key entities in our database:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="frontend/src/assets/readme/chemclick_ERD.png" alt="Entity-Relationship Diagram" width="750">
</div>

### Explanation

- **Students**: Stores basic student information, including a unique `student_id`, `school_email`, hashed `password`, and `admin_id`.
- **Admin**: Stores information about an administrator, including a unique `admin_id` and `email`.
- **Profiles**: Tracks a student's overall progress with `questions_completed` and `questions_correct`. 
- **Lessons**: Contains a unique `lesson_id` and `lesson_name` for each lesson. 
- **Lesson Progress**: Records each student's performance in individual lessons, including `questions_completed` and `questions_correct`. 


### How Data Flows Between Entities
- **Students**: This is the main table that holds the primary information about users (students). Each student:
  - Is assigned to a specific admin through `admin_id` (many-to-one relationship).
  - Has a single profile that tracks their overall progress (one-to-one relationship).
  - Can have multiple lesson progress records (one-to-many relationship).
- **Admin**: Manages multiple students via the `admin_id` field in the `Students` table (one-to-many relationship).
- **Profiles**: Aggregates the overall progress data for each student, linked via `student_id` (one-to-one relationship).
- **Lessons**: Stores information about each lesson and connects to Lesson_Progress for tracking student activity (independent table).
- **Lesson Progress**: Tracks individual student performance for specific lessons. Acts as a bridge table:
  - Links each entry to a specific student via `student_id` (many-to-one relationship).
  - Links each entry to a specific lesson via `lesson_id` (many-to-one relationship).


### Current Status
- The ERD is still a work in progress as we refine and expand the database structure to accommodate additional features.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites: Installing Node.js, React framework, Python, and MongoDB

* npm and node.js installation on MacOS
  ```sh
  # installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
  # download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
  nvm install 22
  # verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
  node -v 
  # verifies the right npm version is in the environment
  npm -v 
  ```
* npm and node.js installation on Windows
  ```sh
  # installs fnm (Fast Node Manager)
  winget install Schniz.fnm
  # configure fnm environment
  fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
  # download and install Node.js
  fnm use --install-if-missing 22
  # verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
  node -v
